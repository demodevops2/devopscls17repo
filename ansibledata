######################################
components of roles:

defaults: it provide the data about the role/application.default variables will be stored in this folder.
files:    put the static files here.
Handlers: kind of refresh or trigger .Tasks which are based on some actions.A Handler is exactly the same as a Task, but it will run when called by another Task.
          - In case my http.conf changes,it should trigger service restart.
		      - This is useful for secondary actions that might be required after running a Task, such as starting a new service after installation or reloading a service after a configuration change.
		  
meta:     it tells about the role, information about the role like Author name,supported platforms etc...Dependencies , if any
tasks:    actions are stored , core logic or code .Installing packages,coping files etc..
Templates : will be stored in the dynamic files -> similar to files except that templates support dynamic files.
vars:     both vars and defaults stores variables.variables stored under "vars" has got high priority.
